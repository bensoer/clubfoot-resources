## What Is An Orthotist ?

An orthotist is a healthcare professional who specializes in designing, fitting, and providing orthotic devices (orthoses) to support or correct musculoskeletal issues. Orthotics are braces, splints, or other devices that help with mobility, alignment, and function by providing support to weakened or misaligned body parts.

For example, an orthotist might create:

* Foot orthotics (custom insoles) to help with pain, posture, or walking difficulties.
* Ankle-foot orthoses (AFOs) to support weak ankles or control foot drop.
* Knee braces for joint stability.
* Spinal braces for conditions like scoliosis.

They often work with physiotherapists, doctors, and prosthetists to help patients with conditions like clubfoot, cerebral palsy, scoliosis, or recovery from injuries.
