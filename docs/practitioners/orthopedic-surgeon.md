## What Is An Orthopedic Surgeon ?
An orthopedic surgeon is a medical doctor (MD) who specializes in diagnosing and surgically treating conditions of the musculoskeletal system — including bones, joints, ligaments, tendons, cartilage, and muscles. They manage structural problems that cause pain, instability, deformity, or loss of function.

They focus on restoring structure and long-term stability in areas like:

* Bone deformities (e.g., clubfoot, limb alignment issues)
* Joint damage (e.g., arthritis, cartilage loss)
* Fractures and traumatic injuries
* Chronic joint instability or tendon rupture
* Advanced structural pain that has not responded to conservative treatment
* Surgical reconstruction, fusion, or replacement procedures

Orthopedic surgeons can also recommend non-surgical treatments (e.g., bracing, injections, physiotherapy referrals), but they are the specialists who perform operations when structural correction is needed.

Unlike a podiatrist, who focuses specifically on foot and ankle care (often including routine care, orthotics, and minor procedures), an orthopedic surgeon manages complex structural problems of the entire musculoskeletal system and performs major reconstructive surgeries.

Where a podiatrist typically manages localized foot conditions and conservative care. An orthopedic surgeon intervenes when structural correction or surgical reconstruction is required.

An orthopedic surgeon can be especially relevant for someone with clubfoot who is dealing with progressive joint degeneration, severe deformity, or chronic structural pain. If conservative care, orthotics, or injections are no longer effective, an orthopedic surgeon can assess options such as tendon transfers, osteotomies (bone realignment), joint fusion, or other reconstructive procedures aimed at improving long-term stability and function.

Orthopedic surgeons are also typically cheaper then podiatrists. In Canada, orthopedic surgeons are covered, vs podiatrists you will have to pay for.
