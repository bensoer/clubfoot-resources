## What Is A Pedorthist ?
A pedorthist is a healthcare professional who specializes in using foot orthotics, footwear modifications, and supportive devices to help with foot and lower limb conditions. Unlike a podiatrist, they do not diagnose medical conditions or perform surgery but focus on non-surgical treatments like:

* Custom orthotics (insoles designed to improve foot alignment and reduce pain)
* Footwear modifications (adjusting shoes for better fit, support, or pressure relief)
* Bracing and supports for conditions like plantar fasciitis, arthritis, or diabetic foot issues
* Gait assessments to determine the best footwear or orthotic solutions
* Pedorthists often work with podiatrists, physiotherapists, and orthotists to help people manage chronic pain, deformities, or mobility issues through properly fitted footwear and orthotic devices.
