# What Is A Podiatrist ?
A podiatrist is a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating conditions affecting the feet, ankles, and lower legs. They can provide medical and surgical care for issues like:

* Foot pain and deformities (e.g., flat feet, high arches, bunions, hammertoes, clubfoot)
* Skin and nail conditions (e.g., ingrown toenails, fungal infections, corns, calluses)
* Diabetic foot care (preventing ulcers, infections, and complications)
* Sports injuries (e.g., sprains, stress fractures, Achilles tendonitis)
* Gait and posture problems (often prescribing orthotics or physical therapy)

Unlike an orthotist, who primarily provides braces and orthotic devices, a podiatrist is a medical specialist who can diagnose conditions, prescribe medications, perform minor procedures, and even do surgery.
