## What Is A Therapist
A therapist (often referred to as a psychotherapist or counsellor) is a licensed mental health professional who helps people understand, process, and manage emotional, psychological, and behavioral challenges. They provide structured talk therapy to support mental health, coping skills, and personal growth.

They focus on areas like:

* Depression and anxiety
* Trauma and grief
* Chronic pain adjustment and emotional coping
* Relationship challenges
* Stress and burnout
* Identity, self-esteem, and life transitions
* Thought patterns and behavioral habits

Therapists use evidence-based approaches such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), trauma-informed therapy, or other structured modalities to help people change unhelpful patterns and build healthier coping strategies.

Unlike a social worker, who often focuses on connecting individuals with community resources, case management, and broader social systems support, a therapist primarily provides ongoing psychological treatment focused on emotional processing and mental health change.

Where a social worker may help you navigate housing, disability services, financial support, or system barriers. A therapist helps you work internally — understanding thoughts, emotions, trauma, and coping patterns.

A therapist can be particularly helpful when living with chronic pain or long-term physical conditions caused by clubfoot. Beyond the physical symptoms, pain often affects identity, relationships, motivation, and hope. A therapist provides a structured space to process those impacts, develop coping tools, and build psychological resilience alongside medical treatment.

Depending where and whom you receive therapy treatment from, can vary on what is covered and offered.
