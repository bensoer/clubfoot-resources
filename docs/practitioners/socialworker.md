# What Is A Social Worker ?
A social worker is a professional who helps people navigate social, emotional, financial, and health-related challenges by providing support, advocacy, and resources. They work in a variety of settings, including healthcare, mental health, child welfare, and community services.

What They Do:

* Counseling and emotional support for people dealing with mental health issues, trauma, or life stressors.
* Connecting people to resources like financial aid, housing, disability services, and healthcare.
* Advocating for clients in legal, medical, or social settings.
* Helping families and individuals navigate difficult life transitions, such as illness, unemployment, or loss.
