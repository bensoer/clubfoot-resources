# What Is An Occupational Therapist ?
An occupational therapist (OT) is a healthcare professional who helps people develop, regain, or adapt their ability to perform daily activities (occupations) when they are affected by injury, disability, or chronic conditions. They focus on functional independence in areas like:

* Self-care (e.g., dressing, cooking, hygiene)
* Work and school tasks (e.g., typing, writing, using tools)
* Mobility and accessibility (e.g., wheelchair skills, adaptive driving)
* Pain and fatigue management (teaching strategies to conserve energy)
* Adaptive equipment and home modifications (e.g., ergonomic tools, grab bars, orthotic supports)

Unlike a physiotherapist, who focuses on physical movement and rehabilitation, an occupational therapist helps people apply movement skills to real-life tasks and may provide tools or techniques to make daily activities easier.
