## What Is A Physiotherapist ?
A physiotherapist (or physical therapist) is a healthcare professional who helps people recover from injuries, manage chronic pain, and improve movement and function through exercise, manual therapy, and education. They focus on:

* Pain management (e.g., chronic pain, joint pain, nerve pain)
* Injury recovery (e.g., sprains, fractures, post-surgery rehab)
* Mobility and strength training (e.g., muscle weakness, balance issues)
* Postural and gait correction (helping people walk more efficiently)
* Neurological rehabilitation (for conditions like stroke, MS, or Parkinsonâ€™s)

Unlike a podiatrist, who focuses specifically on feet and lower limbs, or an orthotist/pedorthist, who provides braces and orthotics, a physiotherapist works on overall movement, strength, and function.
