For clubfoot this is typically an expensive and over-exhaustive process, but it is the only option currently available. The assessment is primarily oriented towards people with spinal injuries or cognitive disabilities. For example, you will be tested on how well you can squeeze your assessors hands and whether you can identify the difference between squares and circles in drawings.</p> <p>The assessment will include testing mobility, cognition, and finally a on-road driving assessment. The on-road driving assessment is the part that will matter the most for your clubfoot. The whole assessment is scheduled for 6 hours, however, because most of the assessment is not relevent for evaluating driving with clubfoot, it typically will complete in under 4 hours.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>When taking your assessment, make sure you have a way to get to and get back from the assessment location without using a vehicle.

The ICBC instructor will likely have already applied the modifications anticipated for the assessment, but depending how the earlier portion of the assessment has gone, your OT may request changes be made for the driving portion</p> <p>Note</p> <p>The vehicle you drive for the assessment can not be decided before hand. The vehicle comes from ICBC, and is often the ICBC instructor's personal vehicle. If the type of vehicle effects your ability to drive with your clubfoot, you will need to regularly mention that to your assessor</p> <p>For the driving assessment here are some tips:</p> <ul> <li>If you are asked to drive with your clubfoot, but feel unsafe to do so. Say so. Do not attempt to drive with your clubfoot.</li> <li>Be vocal about all pains and issues you are experiencing while driving, including any issues while driving with the left foot accelerator. \"pushing through it\" because its new will go unnoticed and undocumented if you do not voice it.</li> <li>Be clear about your driving goals, and issues you are experiencing</li> <li>If the type of vehicle effects your ability to drive, continue to restate how the assessment vehicle helps or hinders your assessment. Describe details of what vehicles do and do not cause issues, and your driving goals in terms of what types of vehicles you plan to drive.</li> </ul> <p>The reason you need to be vocal and upfront about these issues is because the assessment is catered towards applying the least amount of changes as possible. If the OT making the assessment finds you are fit to drive with your right foot, they will not approve installation of the left foot accelerator. The assessments evaluation of whether you are \"able to drive\" is measured by how capable you are, not how comfortable you are or how much you are enjoying it. Additionally, you do not get a refund for the assessment if they decide you do not need a left foot accelerator.</p> <p>Finally, the assessment is more about your ability to drive and/or work with the left foot accelerator.
